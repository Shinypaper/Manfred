			<p>Tony &amp; Claudia had a site that had old content locked in with no way to edit it themselves. Their old site was also not optimized for the modern mobile user of today. This fresh design really shines on mobile devices. We also recognized the need for a way for them to be able to input their new seasonal items, so Wordpress - one of the most popular content management systems - was chosen for them. This gave them exactly what they needed to make their customers happy, hungry, and coming back for more.</p>

						<p>For a mobile view, it was important to maintian maximum functionality, where still retaining the overall feel of the site. Keeping the "contact us" button near the top was important because that is what most people are looking for, especially when browsing the site on a mobile device. It was also important to make sure that the pictures of the food stayed prominently placed, because after all that is what is going to keep Tony &amp; Claudia's customers coming back for more.</p>
