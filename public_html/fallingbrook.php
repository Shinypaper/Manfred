			<p>Tony &amp; Claudia had a site that had old content locked in with no way to edit it themselves. Their old site was also not optimized for the modern mobile user of today. This fresh design really shines on mobile devices. We also recognized the need for a way for them to be able to input their new seasonal items, so Wordpress - one of the most popular content management systems - was chosen for them. This gave them exactly what they needed to make their customers happy, hungry, and coming back for more.</p>
