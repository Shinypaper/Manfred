			<p>Tony &amp; Claudia had a site that had old content locked in with no way to edit it themselves. Their old site was also not optimized for the modern mobile user of today. This fresh design really shines on mobile devices. We also recognized the need for a design that would enable them to add and change their new seasonal items themselves, so Wordpress - one of the most popular content management systems - was chosen for them. This gave them exactly what they needed to make their customers happy, hungry, and coming back for more.</p>

						<p>For mobile formats, it was important to maintain maximum functionality while still retaining the overall feel of the site. Keeping the "contact us" button near the top was important because that is what most people are looking for - especially when browsing the site on a mobile device. It was also important to make sure that the pictures of the food stayed prominently placed because, after all, that&#39;s what is going to keep Tony &amp; Claudia&#39;s customers coming back for more.</p>
