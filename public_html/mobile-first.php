							<h4 class="highlight">Why design mobile first?</h4>
							<p>According to the latest statistics <span class="highlight">more than 70% of all internet users access the web through their primarily through their phones.</span> That means roughly everyone will first see your website on a mobile device.

							<h4 class="highlight">How does this make my new website better?</h4>
							<p>With mobile first design, <span class="highlight">the content shines</span>. Since there is less space to work with priority needs to be given to the content that matters first.</p>

						<div class="mobiletext">
							<h4 class="highlight">What does it mean for bigger screens?</h4>
							<p>Mobile first design doesn't mean desktop last design. Getting your website to look great on mobile devices for what will be almost everyones first look is very important, but that doesn't mean desktops are forgotten.</p>
